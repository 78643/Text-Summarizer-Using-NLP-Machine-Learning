# 📝 Text Summarizer using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is an **AI-powered Text Summarizer** that automatically condenses long passages of text into short, meaningful summaries without losing the essence of the content. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning** models to make content consumption faster, smarter, and more efficient.

## 🚀 Features

* **Extractive Summarization** → Picks out the most important sentences from the text.
* **Abstractive Summarization** → Generates new sentences that capture the original meaning.
* **Preprocessing** → Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and word vectorization.
* **User-friendly Notebook** → Easy to run, test, and experiment with different texts.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Text_Summarizer.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.
* `requirements.txt` → List of required Python libraries.
* `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
* Scikit-learn
* TextRank / TF-IDF
* Deep Learning (for abstractive summarization, optional)
